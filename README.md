# Last War

A Unity project for a mobile 3D action game currently in its early scaffold stage. The repository contains the Unity project structure (Assets, Packages, ProjectSettings) but gameplay scenes and scripts are not implemented yet.

## Project Status
- Basic Unity project folders are available.
- No playable scenes or gameplay features have been added.
- Use this project as a starting point for implementing the game's mechanics and content.
